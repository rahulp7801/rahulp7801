### Rahul P -- @rahulp7801

I'm currently a high school student studying the internals of computers to better understand how the world works on the innovative level that it is at today. I'm also an avid basketball player, and I love to read! #Python Gang I'm also that one [STEM](https://www.ed.gov/stem) kid, if you know you know??

I have experience in both front-end and back-end development, although I prefer back-end by a ton.

I stand by this moral knowing that not everything is going to be my way. I understand that I need to take the risks to become successful. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a Discord Bot coded in Python, it is reaching the end of alpha. I'll update this README with the link when it is out of beta as well!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and Java, to create applications that can be used cross-platform. I am also learning [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) and [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/), but I am experienced with using [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).
- I love Python, and it is one of my all-time favorite languages.
- 😄 I love to play basketball, code, and listen to music! In general, I am deep into the STEM ecosystem!!
