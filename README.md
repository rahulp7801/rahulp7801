## 🚀 About Me
- I love blending **software + hardware** to create solutions that are practical and fun.  
- Self-taught pretty much all of my stack — I believe the best way to learn is to **build and break things**.  
- Outside of code, you’ll probably find me lifting heavy weight 🏋🏻‍♂️, folding random things out of paper ✂️, or playing NBA 2K 🏀.

## 🛠️ Projects I’m Proud Of
- **InfiniBot** 🧩  
  Pioneered the **first-of-its-kind unified Discord bot**, consolidating 20+ bots into one system with Google Classroom, Maps, and Yelp API integrations. Served **15K+ users across 50+ guilds**, redefining online community engagement.  

- **WealthWise** 💸  
  Co-developed an **AI-powered web app** for personalized financial consulting. Presented at the **U.S. Capitol** for its impact on financial literacy and inclusion.  

- **Club Discovery Platform** 🔍  
  Built a Next.js + Vercel platform that centralized discovery for **100+ school clubs**, using Pandas for ranking & filtering. Officially adopted as the school’s endorsed system.  

- **WebSocket Chat App** 💬  
  Created a React.js + WebSocket chat platform to **bypass school restrictions** when other apps were blocked. Adopted by two full classes and some clubs as a reliable way to plan meetups and communicate.

## 🌟 Fun Facts
- I like making gifts out of folded paper... because sometimes low-tech is just as cool as high-tech.  
- I’m always learning something new: lately, it’s been that I can safely skip leg day by walking 20,000 steps on this hilly campus. 
- I once built a chat app just so my friends and I could bypass school WiFi restrictions... necessity really is the mother of invention.
